# K4.5 Robot
This robot, which I designed in an effort to pattern after and be inspired by the K9 police dog, was developed using a Raspberry Pi 4. It is capable of carrying out a variety of tasks.

The K4.5 Robot has its own GUI to control through the interface, but you can also command it with your voice.
  
Here are what the K4.5 robot is capable to do:
  
**1. Voice recognition commands**
* Activate by saying "Hey 4.5"
* Everything can be command by your voice, it is trained to recognize it's named being called out in the background (Ex: "Hey four point five!") and then it will wake up to listen to you.
* It is able to eliminate noise or other people chatting loudly in the background, only wake up if it hears its name's being called.
  
**2. Safe - Guard mode**
* Activate by saying anything with the keyword: "Safe - Guard"
* With this mode activated, the robot will guard a specific area (hallway, door, entrance, etc ...) and it will continously guarding that area
* It will consider the guarding are is a restricted area and if anybody is found to be entering the restricted area they will be considered as intruder, K4.5 will sound an alarm and send the message of the intruder to your phone.
  
**3. Safe - Keeping mode**
* Activate by saying anything with the keyword: "Safe - Keeping"
* In contrast with Safe - Guard mode, this mode allows you to keep a person in a specific area, imagine after you catched an intruder and you want to keep them in an area so you can do anything else (calling the police, etc ...), all you'll have to do is to face K4.5 toward the one you need to keep and activate the mode.
* If people attempting to escape or leaving the area, K4.5 will sound a very loud alarm and imediately send message of the person it's keeping to your phone
  
**4. Fall Detection mode (a little bit advance)**
* Activate by saying anything with the keyword: "Fall detection"
* The robot will continously watching and following you, if you went to the left, it will peek to the left and vice versa.
* If you are doing something and all of a sudden, you fall down to the ground (like a stroke), K4.5 will be able to detect that you have just fallen and you need assistance, it will capture the image of the person that has just fell down and immediately send the image to your phone, it will also sound the alarm for help and prompt to call the emergency.
* This mode can be used to keep the baby or the elder people at home to make you feel safer while at work!
  
**5. Spy mode**
* Activate by saying anything with the keyword: "Spy"
* You will be able to control the robot with your bluetooth keyboard to explore the surrounding (the range is very good because its depend on the range of your wireless keyboard, the robot will have no trouble in the range once it's connected to wifi.
* K4.5 has a camera and you can view what the robot is seeing, this is basically like a drone but on the terrain
 
**6. Calculate math**
* Activate by asking anything about the 4 basics math operation to K4.5.
* For example, ask it "what is 2+3" and it will spin around for 5 times. Ask it "what is 20/5" and it will spin for 4 times, as long as the results is below 10 and it's the 4 basics math operation (+, -, x, รท)
* *Note: I limited the answer to be below 10 doesn not mean that it can just capable of doing simple maths, it is because if the result is too high (for example 23x10=120, 135+170=305) it would still be able to calculate the result but it would be hard for you to keep track of the spinning.*
  
**7. Message control (Telegram)**
* K4.5 have its own Telegram chatbot and it can be command by the message you send to the chatbot
* You can command it about the moving direction (for example, turn left for 2 seconds, go forward for 3 seconds, go backward for 1 second, ...)
